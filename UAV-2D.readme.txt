This program computes the trajectory of a 2D UAV following a desired planned trajectory:
- uncomment any of the planned trajectories in uav_2d_main to use it as a reference. You can create new ones if you want to
- execute uav_2d_main

Other functions:
- uav_2d_eom.m contains the Equations of Motion
- controller.m contains the control law
- parameters.m contains the system constants
