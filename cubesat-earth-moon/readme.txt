This program computes the evolution of the orbit of a cubesat in an Earth-Moon system. It can be studies how a Solar sail can assist an orbit transfer from the Earth to the Moon.

- cube_sat2.m and f_orbit.m contain the model
- Results satellite 2.pptx show the solutions for three different initial conditions
