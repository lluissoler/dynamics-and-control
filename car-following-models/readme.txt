Simulink models for different car following models:
- PID.mdl: car following model using PID control.
- BangBang.mdl: car following model using PID control.
- SafeBreakingRule.mdl: in this case a leading vehicle follows a stop-and-go traffic. Both vehicles are 20 ft in length. The steady state following distance under the “DMV rule” for 88 ft/sec (or 60 mph) is six car lengths or 120 ft.
